Embarking on my journey as a data enthusiast, I initially cultivated my skills in Product Management and Marketing, where the imperative for evidence-based decisions was pivotal. From the early days of my data career, I have maintained a proactive stance, consistently seeking opportunities for improvement and willingly engaging in challenging tasks. In transitioning to Data Analyst roles, I consistently applied my business acumen to scrutinize business and internal processes, actively seeking opportunities to enhance workflow efficiency. This often involved implementing automated workflows for streamlined operations.

I played a crucial role in achieving an 80% reduction in report processing time at the McKinstry Charitable Foundation by integrating data from diverse sources and transforming it into a cohesive framework. I utilized tools such as Excel and PowerBI to streamline the process effectively. Furthermore, at JND Legal Administration, I personally crafted multiple standardized scripts and stored procedures using SQL, resulting in a significant 50% reduction in time spent on routine tasks for the team in my first 3 months.

In my pursuit of advancing expertise, I broadened my horizons by enrolling in a Master's program in Data Science at Seattle University. Collaborating with intellectual peers, I delved into intricate topics such as machine learning, data visualization, and statistics, further enriching my understanding and skills in the dynamic field of data science.
